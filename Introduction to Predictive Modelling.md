To estimate recreational activity and the economic impact thereof, however, requires detailed visitation data which is often unavailable for protected areas, especially where access is free of charge.
Thus, as a substitute for traditional methods for getting data, this research evaluates a methodology which allows to estimate the home locations of social media users.
Using geo-tagged photographs metadata from flicker, it predicts German National Park visitor's home location.
Max PUD(Photo-user-days (PUD), i.e., unique combinations of user
and date,) and logistic regression are used to predict visitors' home location.
Then, it compares the prediction to the survey data.
Results show that photograph metadata can be used to assign home locations with accuracies between 62 and 89% depending on the spatial scale implemented.
Spatial scale(0: country,> 1: federal states, 2:county), accuracy(0>1>2)
