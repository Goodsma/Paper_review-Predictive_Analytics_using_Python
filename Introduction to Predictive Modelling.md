To estimate recreational activity and the economic impact thereof, however, requires detailed visitation data which is often unavailable for protected areas, especially where access is free of charge.
Thus, as a substitute for traditional methods for getting data, this research evaluates a methodology which allows to estimate the home locations of social media users.
Using geo-tagged photographs metadata from flicker, it predicts German National Park visitor's home location.
Max PUD(Photo-user-days (PUD), i.e., unique combinations of user
and date,) and logistic regression are used to predict visitors' home location.
Then, it compares the prediction to the survey data.
Results show that photograph metadata can be used to assign home locations with accuracies between 62 and 89% depending on the spatial scale implemented.
Spatial scale(0: country,> 1: federal states, 2:county), accuracy(0>1>2)

The study's aim was to examine the link between perceived festival service quality, satisfaction, buying wine at the event and the first‐time/repeat visitor dynamic.
17 service quality and 3 satisfaction items was designed. Then, factor analysis was done with these. It was concluded that the analysis was acceptable through some tests.
The factors are as follows F1: Generic features and service staff, F2: Entertainment and catering, F3: Comfort amenities, F4: Festival venue and information, S1: Satisfaction.
Logistic regression is used to assess the impact of a set of predictors such as perceived quality and overall satisfaction on a dependent variable (wine buying).
Through the Wald test, it can be seen that only overall satisfaction features S1 contribute significantly to the predictive ability of the model.
