*__1__*. First is developing an understanding of the application domain and the relevant prior knowledge and identifying the goal of the KDD process from the customerâ€™s viewpoint.

*__2__*. Second is creating a target data set: selecting a data set, or focusing on a subset of variables or data samples, on which discovery is to be performed.

*__3__*. Third is data cleaning and preprocessing. Basic operations include removing noise if appropriate, collecting the necessary information to model or account for noise, deciding
on strategies for handling missing data fields, and accounting for time-sequence information and known changes.

*__4__*. Fourth is data reduction and projection: finding useful features to represent the data depending on the goal of the task. With dimensionality reduction or transformation methods, the effective number of variables under consideration can be reduced, or invariant representations for the data can be found.

*__5__*. Fifth is matching the goals of the KDD process (step 1) to a particular data-mining method. For example, summarization, classification, regression, clustering, and so on, are described later as well as in Fayyad, Piatetsky- Shapiro, and Smyth (1996).

*__6__*. Sixth is exploratory analysis and model and hypothesis selection: choosing the datamining algorithm(s) and selecting method(s) to be used for searching for data patterns. This process includes deciding which models and parameters might be appropriate (for example, models of categorical data are different than models of vectors over the reals) and matching a particular data-mining method with the overall criteria of the KDD process (for example, the end user might be more interested in understanding the model than its predictive capabilities).

*__7__*. Seventh is data mining: searching for patterns of interest in a particular representational form or a set of such representations, including classification rules or trees, regression, and clustering. The user can significantly aid the data-mining method by correctly performing the preceding steps.

*__8__*. Eighth is interpreting mined patterns, possibly returning to any of steps 1 through 7 for further iteration. This step can also involve visualization of the extracted patterns and models or visualization of the data given the extracted models.

*__9__*. Ninth is acting on the discovered knowledge: using the knowledge directly, incorporating the knowledge into another system for further action, or simply documenting it and reporting it to interested parties. This process also includes checking for and resolving potential conflicts with previously believed (or extracted) knowledge.
