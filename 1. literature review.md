To estimate recreational activity and the economic impact thereof, however, requires detailed visitation data which is often unavailable for protected areas, especially where access is free of charge.
Thus, as a substitute for traditional methods for getting data, this research evaluates a methodology which allows to estimate the home locations of social media users.
Using geo-tagged photographs metadata from flicker, it predicts German National Park visitor's home location.
Max PUD(Photo-user-days (PUD), i.e., unique combinations of user
and date,) and logistic regression are used to predict visitors' home location.
Then, it compares the prediction to the survey data.
Results show that photograph metadata can be used to assign home locations with accuracies between 62 and 89% depending on the spatial scale implemented.
Spatial scale(0: country,> 1: federal states, 2:county), accuracy(0>1>2)

The study's aim was to examine the link between perceived festival service quality, satisfaction, buying wine at the event and the first‐time/repeat visitor dynamic.
17 service quality and 3 satisfaction items was designed. Then, factor analysis was done with these. It was concluded that the analysis was acceptable through some tests.
The factors are as follows F1: Generic features and service staff, F2: Entertainment and catering, F3: Comfort amenities, F4: Festival venue and information, S1: Satisfaction.
Logistic regression is used to assess the impact of a set of predictors such as perceived quality and overall satisfaction on a dependent variable (wine buying).
Through the Wald test, it can be seen that only overall satisfaction features S1 contribute significantly to the predictive ability of the model.

this paper propse an approach to predict how many future visitors will go to a restaurante using  big data and supervised learning.
data involves restaurant information, historical visits and historical reservations.
K-Nearest-Neighbour, Random Forests and XGBoost are used.
To avoid the bias brought from a single regressor mean of all predictions from the three regressors is used as the final prediction.

The identification of characteristics associated with an outcome has importance in comparing alternative treatments, designing clinical trials, and counselling individual patients. There are problems of overfitting and of identifying important covariates in the previously used way. This paper compared three alternative methods of model fitting varying sample size. 1)Stepwise variable selection 2)Incomplete principal components 3)Variable clusters/indices To measure prognosis of patients index c is used. The c index is the proportion of all pairs of patients for which we could determine the ordering of survival times such that the predictions are concordant.<br>
1)Stepwise variable selection showed inferior results, especially as the training sample size decreases. Interpretation of the results of a stepwise variable selection strategy can be difficult since there is great variation in the factors chosen.<br>
2)Incomplete principal components showed quite good and their performance does not depend on the sample size. But their are 2 drawbacks.  1 one never excludes variables. 2 the models are difficult to interpret, especially beyond the first pc.<br>
3)Variable clusters/indices showed performance compare favourably with the second models and superior to the first models and is more interpretable than second models.

The aim of this research work is applying a suitable forecasting technique to predict web site visits.
For this, this research identify and investigate data mining techniques which can be used for time series data forecasting.
So one approach of handling time series data is removing its temporal ordering so that standard propositional learning algorithms can process them. Here when removing the temporal ordering, the time dependent data should be encoded via additional input fields. These fields are known as 'lagged' variables. After data has been transformed, regression algorithms can be applied to learn a model.
And this research also Identify and apply suitable pre-processing techniques to clean the data.
It is removing outliers, the values which are out of the μ–σ to μ+σ range will be removed and assigned with mean value.
Based on the evaluation results we can conclude that SMO regression and Linear Regression algorithms are better suited for forecasting web site related information and also using Linear Regression on pre-processed data gives more accurate results.
