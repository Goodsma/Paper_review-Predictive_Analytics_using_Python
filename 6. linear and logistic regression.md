Covid-19 mortality rate varies so greatly across countries. This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in
Covid-19 mortality. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, linear regressions were applied to a
cross-sectional dataset comprising 169 countries.(multiple regression - 101 countries)<br>
It retrieved data from the Worldometer website, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and Logistics Performance Indicators databases.
Increasing Covid-19 testing, improving government effectiveness and increasing hospital beds may have the potential to attenuate Covid-19 mortality.<br>
The results were measured by r and p(multiple regression -  R-squared, RR, P) and visualized by scatter plot.

In this paper, market values of the football players in the forward positions are estimated using multiple linear regression by including the physical and performance factors in 2017-2018 season. 
It seeks relevant factors that affect the market value of a football player in forward position.
Both league and cup performances of the footballers are taken, and the data is gathered from the Transfermarkt.
In this study, we evaluated football players with several criteria in different significance levels within the consideration
of multicollinearity and homoscedasticity. As a result, we have achieved to build a regression model in 0.10
significance level with 52 attributes, %20 MAPE and and 0.86 adjusted ùëÖ-squared value.
