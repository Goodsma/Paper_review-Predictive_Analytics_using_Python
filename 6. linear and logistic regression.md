Covid-19 mortality rate varies so greatly across countries. This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in
Covid-19 mortality. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, linear regressions were applied to a
cross-sectional dataset comprising 169 countries.(multiple regression - 101 countries)<br>
It retrieved data from the Worldometer website, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and Logistics Performance Indicators databases.
Increasing Covid-19 testing, improving government effectiveness and increasing hospital beds may have the potential to attenuate Covid-19 mortality.<br>
The results were measured by r and p(multiple regression -  R-squared, RR, P) and visualized by scatter plot.
