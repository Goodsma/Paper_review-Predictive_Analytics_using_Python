Covid-19 mortality rate varies so greatly across countries. This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in
Covid-19 mortality. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, linear regressions were applied to a
cross-sectional dataset comprising 169 countries.(multiple regression - 101 countries)<br>
It retrieved data from the Worldometer website, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and Logistics Performance Indicators databases.
Increasing Covid-19 testing, improving government effectiveness and increasing hospital beds may have the potential to attenuate Covid-19 mortality.<br>
The results were measured by r and p(multiple regression -  R-squared, RR, P) and visualized by scatter plot.

In this paper, market values of the football players in the forward positions are estimated using multiple linear regression by including the physical and performance factors in 2017-2018 season. 
It seeks relevant factors that affect the market value of a football player in forward position.
Both league and cup performances of the footballers are taken, and the data is gathered from the Transfermarkt.
In this study, we evaluated football players with several criteria in different significance levels within the consideration
of multicollinearity and homoscedasticity. As a result, we have achieved to build a regression model in 0.10
significance level with 52 attributes, %20 MAPE and and 0.86 adjusted ùëÖ-squared value.

In this paper, by applying linear regression for forecasting behavior of TCS data set, we
prove that our proposed method is best to compare the
other regression techniquemethod. 
The dataset that was used was collected from the TCS Stock Database
Open price,High price, Low price and Number of
trend consider as input independent variable and
Close price is consider as target dependent variable
and date is used as index variable.
It analyzed that linear regression model provide best result compared to polynomial and RBF regression.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the characteristics of internet banking users in Northern Cyprus.
Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of age, gender, income, marital status, education, profession, comfort level with computers and previous experience of shopping online on the likelihood of people using internet banking.

These are proposed that: <br>

H1: Younger individuals are more likely to adopt internet banking<br>
H2: Males are more likely to adopt internet banking<br>
H3: Higher income individuals are more likely to adopt internet banking<br>
H4: Married couples are more likely to adopt internet banking<br>
H5: Educated individuals are more likely to adopt internet banking<br>
H6: Banking personnel are more likely to adopt internet banking<br>
H7: An increased comfort level with computers increases the likelihood of internet banking adoption<br>
H8: Previous online shopping experience increases the chance of internet banking adoption<br>

except H4 every hypothesis is accepted.

Identification of sex from images or videos is crucial for applications in visual surveillance, content-based searching by investigation agencies, and in forensic science.
Facial landmarks is used as the basis of discrimination between images of males and females.
FaceScrub, SCface database is used.
The 11 facial indices were extracted from these landmarks and used for further analysis.
Box plots were drawn and summary statistics of each of these indices were tabulated for both the sexes.
Using the forward and backward selection methods, only the indices having significance value < 0.0001 were kept.
Three of these indices were not found significant as such dropped from further analysis.
Logistic regression and likely hood ratio approach, and CNN model is used.
Confusion matrix is a common metric for the evaluation of all the classifiers.
The overall performance of logistics regression is slightly less than the CNN classifier.
But logistic regression has a advantage of interpretability
