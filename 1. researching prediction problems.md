There are various types of Classification problems
## Binary Classification
Spam mail, and Fraud detection<br>

ML algorithms:<br>
Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree

Metrics:<br>
Accuracy, Log-loss, F1-score, AUC-ROC score
## Multi-class Classification
Face Recognition, Animals Classification, Optical Character Recognition

ML algorithms:<br>
k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest

Metrics:<br>
Micro averaged F1, Macro averaged F1, Precision, Recall score, Multi-class log loss
## Multi-label Classification
Stackoverflow Tags Prediction, Movie Genre Prediction<br>

ML algorithms:<br>
Multi-labeled Decision Tree, Multi-labeled Random Forest, Multi-labeled Gradient Boosting

Metrics:<br>
Micro averaged F1, Macro averaged F1, Precision, Recall score, Hamming Loss, Log-loss

### Email Spam
The goal is to predict whether an email is a spam.
Text is a simple sequence of words which is the input(X).
The goal is to predict the binary response Y:spam or not.
The first step is to process the raw data into a vector.
A set of 57 most common words and punctuation marks are pre-selected by researchers.
This is where domain knowledge plays an important role.
then in every e-mail message we would compute  the percentage of times this word appears with respect to the total number of words in the email message.
then model is trained. In the future when a new email message is received, the algorithm will analyze the text sequence and compute the relative frequency for these 57 identified words.

### Handwritten Digit Recognition
The goal is to identify images of single digits 0 - 9 correctly.
The images has 16 x 16 pixels. To the computer, an image is a matrix, and every pixel in the image corresponds to one entry in the matrix.
Every entry is an integer ranging from a pixel intensity of 0 (black) to 255(white). The image matrix was scanned row by row and then arranged into 
a large 256-dimensional vector. This is used as the input to train the classifier.
